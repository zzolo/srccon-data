# How to get around
There are two train lines in the Twin Cities. One runs through Minneapolis and the other runs from Minneapolis to St. Paul. Mercifully, they are connected. The MetroTransit trip planner (<a href='https://www.metrotransit.org/imap/map.aspx'>https://www.metrotransit.org/imap/map.aspx</a>) is a reliable way to determine if your destination is near a train stop. Many of the places listed here are.

There is also a bike sharing system called [Nice Ride](https://www.niceridemn.org/) that has over 100 stations throughout the core cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Stations are usually pretty close to many of the attractions listed below, including right behind the McNamara Center. Passes are $6 for 24 hours or $15 for a month, you get bikes for 60 minutes at a time before additional fees accrue.

There is no shortage of Ethiopian options in the Twin Cities, but there is an emerging concensus around the greatness of Fasika.

##### Matt's Bar
<a href='http://mattsbar.com'>http://mattsbar.com</a><br />
3.9 miles<br />
3500 Cedar Avenue<br />

This is the place you go for the local novelty food: The Jucy Lucy (yes, that is how they spell it). It's also where, not too long ago, POTUS went for the local novelty food. Here's the thing: This novelty is also a legitimately great burger. And Matt's a legitimately great dive.

##### Khyber Pass Cafe (Afghan)
<a href='http://khyberpasscafe.com'>http://khyberpasscafe.com</a><br />

##### Sea Salt (Seafood)
<a href='https://seasalteatery.wordpress.com'>https://seasalteatery.wordpress.com</a><br />
6.4 miles<br />
4825 Minnehaha Avenue<br />

Let's be honest--this is Minnesota, so we are also talking *lake* food. But you know what? Lake food is delicious and you'll be eating it at an outdoor table within earshot (and from some tables within eyeshot) of Minnehaha Falls. And the whole thing is just a short walk from a lightrail stop.

## Beautiful places

##### Guthrie Theater
<a href='http://www.guthrietheater.org'>http://www.guthrietheater.org</a><br />
2.2 miles<br />
818 South 2nd Street<br />

The Guthrie was built for plays, but anybody can walk in anytime and step out onto their "Endless Bridge" which overlooks Mississippi River and the ruins of the city's flour milling industry.

##### Gold Medal Park
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Medal_Park'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Medal_Park</a><br />
2.2 miles<br />

Gold Medal Park is a lovely picnic spot. Its right next to the Guthrie, which means you can also get in on the magic of the Endless Bridge. It's also right by Izzy's Ice Cream (see above). Seriously--it is your destiny.

##### Minnehaha Falls
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnehaha_Park_'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnehaha_Park_</a><br />(Minneapolis)
5.2 miles<br />
4825 Minnehaha Avenue<br />

A waterfall, hiking trails, and a great seafood restauraunt. Oh, and you can rent those crazy four-person bikes and pretend you are in the things-are'splendid montage of a romantic comedy!

##### Walker Art Center Sculpture Garden
<a href='https://www.walkerart.org/garden/#map-overview/'>https://www.walkerart.org/garden/#map-overview/</a><br />
4.5 miles<br />
1750 Hennepin Avenue<br />

You know that giant spoon with a giant cherry in it that appears on postcards and special broadcasts from Minneapolis? This is where it lives. And that is fine--it's kind of cool. But there is so much more at the Walker Art Center's sculpture garden. And they've got artist-designed mini-golf!

##### University of Minnesota Landscape Arboretum
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Landscape_Arboretum'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Landscape_Arboretum</a><br />
26.4 miles<br />
3675 Arboretum Drive, Chaska, MN<br />

If you need a quiet place for a stroll, or just want to sit and think while surrounded by pretty growy things, you might think about the arboretum. It's a rental car thing for sure. There is a pretty insane LEGO exhibit there now. And then there is a Prince perk: To get there you have to drive by the compound he calls Paisely Park (which is also where he holds his occasional 2am concerts). If we're being honest, it is not aging well. But Prince!

## Books!
These bookstores are vetted. There are plenty more that could (and maybe should) be on the list, but you can't go wrong with any of these (unless, of course, if you hate science fiction and decide to truck it out to Uncle Hugo's). Two things worth noting: Common Good Books is Garrison Keilor's bookstore (Wait! Come back!) and Wild Rumpus is a bookstore for kids that has LIVE ANIMALS running around. And we're not just talking about  bookstore cats. There are chickens!

##### The Book House

## Records!
Like the bookstores, these record stores are vetted! Three things worth noting: Fifth Element is the record store of the Minneapolis Hip Hop collective Rhymesayers (Atmosphere, Brother Ali, P.O.S.), Electric Fetus is a super gross name and a really great store, and Treehouse used to be called Oar Folkjokeopus and was sort of the uniffial HQ of Twin/Tone records, early home to Minneapolis bands like The Replacements, Babes in Toyland, Soul Asylum, and The Jayhawks. It's also where the guys from Husker Du met.

##### Ax-Man Surplus Store
<a href='http://www.ax-man.com'>http://www.ax-man.com</a><br />
3.2 miles<br />
1639 University Avenue West<br />

The most freakishly delightful surplus store this side of the Mississippi. Not military surplus, but *everything* surplus. People walk through the aisles making joyful sounds. For real.

##### House of Balls

##### Franconia Sculpture Park
<a href='http://www.franconia.org'>http://www.franconia.org</a><br />
47.5 miles<br />
29836 Saint Croix Trail, Shafer, MN<br />

There is a house suspended from wires, a sculpture made of boom boxes that reaches towards the heavens... Many of the sculptures are welded, formed, and banged together on site. It's sprawling and it's amazing.


##### Duluth (Lake Superior)
150 miles<br />

It's a 2.5 hour drive, but it's a great little city on a really big lake. If you are a Dylan person, he was born in Duluth and lived there at 519 N. 3rd Ave. E. until he was six. Or maybe you are a Prince person...


##### Purple Rain locations, because Prince
<a href='http://www.mapquest.com/travel/articles/prince-purple-rain-30th-anniversary-minneapolis-tour-20884977'>http://www.mapquest.com/travel/articles/prince-purple-rain-30th-anniversary-minneapolis-tour-20884977</a>

Have you watched that movie lately? If so, you've probably already clicked that link.
